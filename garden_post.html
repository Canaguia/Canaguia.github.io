                    <p>
                        I had the tremendous privelage to be able to work with the kind and talented people at <a href="https://arl.cs.washington.edu/index.html">ARL Animation Research Labs</a> where I got to
                        experience working in an animation production pipeline environment alongside an interdisciplinary group of students from several different fields! <br><br>

                        I got to work with a team of of 17 dedicated students and teaching assistants for over a year on two major animated film projects.
                        This post is to reflect on my year long exeperience with ARL working on two short-films and multiple side projects and the lessons learned, the challenges faced and how they were overcome.

                    <h2>Planning</h2>
                    <p>
                        Before development on the year long film a pilot film with a smaller team was done. This shortfilm was done over a much smaller timeframe with 6 others.
                        The core of this project was creating a character known as "Greed".

                        Key points at this stage was gathering reference and rapid storyboarding.

                        As rigging and scripting lead my contributions were:
                        - Understanding the exsiting capstone auto-rigging shelves built in Maya and Python
                        - Creating files to apply auto-rigging to humanoid and non-humanoid models
                        - Adding to the existing capstone toolset via a neat little script to help animators copy skin-weights within maya to models with the same geometry (was useful as many characters had several duplicated leaf-geometries)

    # Get all selected objects with the specific suffix "_source"
    selection = cmds.ls(sl=True, long=True)
    selection_names = [name.split('|')[-1] for name in selection]
    print(selection_names)
    source_objects = [obj for obj in selection_names if obj.endswith('_source')]
    
    for source_obj in source_objects:
        target_obj = source_obj.replace('_source', '')
        
        if cmds.objExists(target_obj):
            cmds.select([source_obj, target_obj])
            cmds.CopySkinWeights()
        else:
            print("Target object '{}' not found.".format(target_obj))

                        As a modeller I was in charge of the set which was a large undertaking. This process required me to

                        One of the major challenges was optimizing performance for real-time rendering. To overcome this:
