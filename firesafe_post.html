                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Revisiting this project years after its completion has provided an opportunity to reflect on both its successes and challenges. The project, developed in cooperation with CrashCourse for FireSafe, aimed to create an immersive fire safety training simulation using VR. This postmortem highlights key design decisions, technical implementations, and lessons learned along the way.</p>

                <h2>Project Overview</h2>
                <p>Initially scoped as a three-month sprint during the summer, the project ultimately spanned approximately nine months due to delays in obtaining permissions and design guidelines. Despite these setbacks, the project can be divided into three distinct phases:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pre-production</strong> – Establishing core systems and design choices.</li>
                    <li><strong>Production</strong> – Sourcing assets, structuring the simulation’s flow, and implementing key mechanics.</li>
                    <li><strong>Testing, Quality Control, and Launch</strong> – Refining interactions, improving usability, and ensuring a polished final product.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <h2>Pre-production</h2>
                <h3>Project Definition & Constraints</h3>
                <p>At the outset, the project’s goals were unclear. As the sole developer, I focused on identifying essential components that would define the experience. One of my first steps was analyzing CrashCourse’s previous project, <em>Go Save Them VR</em>, to understand how its mechanics and design choices could inform this new simulation.</p>

                <h2>Core Systems</h2>
                <h3>Fire Extinguisher Interaction</h3>
                <p>The fire extinguisher was the most critical element and underwent multiple iterations to achieve a balance of realism and usability. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Holding Mechanic:</strong> Implemented using Unity’s XR Toolkit, allowing realistic two-hand grip.</li>
                    <li><strong>Pin Removal:</strong> Used a soft joint system to prevent accidental detachment.</li>
                    <li><strong>Spray Mechanism:</strong> Leveraged Unity’s particle system, balancing performance with realism.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Fire System</h3>
                <p>The simulation used <em>Ignis</em>, an asset that provided interactive fire behavior but required significant modifications to meet the training objectives.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Controlled Spread:</strong> Prevented instant fire propagation by defining fire volumes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Persistence of Fire:</strong> Adjusted extinguishing behavior to reinforce proper technique.</li>
                    <li><strong>Player Guidance:</strong> Added visual indicators to improve learning outcomes.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Establishing Requirements</h3>
                <p>Once development resumed, finalized requirements from FireSafe allowed for structured milestone planning. Features were broken down into prioritized milestones, tracked using Trello.</p>

                <h3>Game Flow & Levels</h3>
                <p>The simulation was designed for unsupervised use, requiring intuitive onboarding. Three scenes were created:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Entry Scene:</strong> Users input their information.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tutorial Scene:</strong> Training on VR locomotion and extinguisher usage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Demo Scene:</strong> A fire scenario in a hotel lobby requiring players to locate and extinguish a fire.</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

                <p>Early testing revealed that onboarding required refinement:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Added visual indicators for navigation.</li>
                    <li>Refined extinguisher mechanics based on feedback.</li>
                    <li>Enhanced smoke effects for realism.</li>
                </ul>
